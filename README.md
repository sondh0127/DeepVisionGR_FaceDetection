# Facial-Detecion

## Overview
Using WIDER FACE Dataset to detect human face using Single Shot Detection

## Installation

The necessary dependencies are in the requirements.txt file so just run this before running the actual code to get them installed. May require some extra effort for OpenCV though.

``
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
``

## Usage

Download the dataset and either change "DRIVE_BASE_PATH" in config/path.py or put the dataset into dataset folder.
